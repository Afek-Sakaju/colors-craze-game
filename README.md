# Colors-Craze-Game

## Overview

### Color Clearing Game is a fun and challenging game where you clear enemy colors from a table full of colors. Each level features a different set of enemy colors that you must clear by changing the color of squares on the table. To change a item's color, simply click on it, and it will regenerate a new color. The goal is to clear all the enemy colors from the table to advance to the next level. <br />
